      We come from many places, cultures, and backgrounds, but share a strong common commitment to personal inner growth, wellness, sustainability, and positive values.<br/>
      Many of us have experienced the stress and negativity so common at other colleges. That's why we came to MUM!<br/>
      We support a progressive and inclusive campus culture thatâ€™s creative, dynamic, and focused on making the world a better, more peaceful place.<br/>
